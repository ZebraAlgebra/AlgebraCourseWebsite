% Problem 1

Let $A$ be a local ring, $M$ and $N$ finitely generated $A$-modules.

Prove that if $M \otimes N=0$, then $M=0$ or $N=0$.

[Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal, $k=A / \mathfrak{m}$ the residue field.

Let $M_k=k \otimes_A M \cong$ $M / \mathfrak{m} M$ by Exercise 2.

By Nakayama's lemma, $M_k=0 \Rightarrow M=0$.

But $M \otimes_A N=0 \Rightarrow\left(M \otimes_A N\right)_k=0 \Rightarrow M_k \otimes_k N_k=0 \Rightarrow M_k=0$ or $N_k=0$,
since $M_k, N_k$ are vector spaces over a field.]

% Problem 2

Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module and $\phi: M \rightarrow A^n$ a surjective homomorphism. Show that $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ is finitely generated.

[Let $e_1, \ldots, e_n$ be a basis of $A^n$ and choose $u_i \in M$ such that $\phi\left(u_i\right)=e_i$ $(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n)$. Show that $M$ is the direct sum of $\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)$ and the submodule generated by $\left.u_1, \ldots, u_n \cdot\right]$

% Problem 3

Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be an ideal of a ring $A$, and let $S=1+\mathfrak{a}$.

Show that $S^{-1} \mathfrak{a}$ is contained in the Jacobson radical of $S^{-1} A$.

Use this result and Nakayama's lemma to give a proof of (2.5) which does not depend on determinants.

[If $M=\mathfrak{a} M$, then $S^{-1} M=\left(S^{-1} \mathfrak{a}\right)\left(S^{-1} M\right)$, hence by Nakayama we have $S^{-1} M=0$. Now use Exercise 1.]

% Problem 4

The set $S_0$ of all non-zero-divisors in $A$ is a saturated multiplicatively closed subset of $A$.

Hence the set $D$ of zero-divisors in $A$ is a union of prime ideals (see Chapter 1, Exercise 14).

Show that every minimal prime ideal of $A$ is contained in D. [Use Exercise 6.]

The ring $S_0^{-1} A$ is called the \textit{total ring of fractions} of $A$.

Prove that

\begin{itemize}
    \item i) $S_0$ is the largest multiplicatively closed subset of $A$ for which the homomorphism $A \rightarrow S_0^{-1} A$ is injective.

    \item ii) Every element in $S_0^{-1} A$ is either a zero-divisor or a unit.

    \item iii) Every ring in which every non-unit is a zero-divisor is equal to its total ring of fractions (i.e., $A \rightarrow S_0^{-1} A$ is bijective).
\end{itemize}

% Problem 5
[Nakayama's lemma]

Let $R$ be any ring and $M$ a finitely generated module.

Let $N$ be the radical of $R$.

If $N M=M$ show that $M=0$.

[Hint: Observe that the proof of Nakayama's lemma still holds.]

% Problem 6
\begin{itemize}
    \item (a) Let $J$ be a two-sided nilpotent ideal of $R$. Show that $J$ is contained in the radical.
    \item (b) Conversely, assume that $R$ is Artinian. Show that its radical is nilpotent, i.e., that there exists an integer $r \geqq 1$ such that $N^r=0$. [Hint: Consider the descending sequence of powers $N^r$, and apply Nakayama to a minimal finitely generated left ideal $L \subset N^{\infty}$ such that $N^{\infty} L \neq 0$.]
\end{itemize}
