# Questions - Week 01

## Problem 1

A partially ordered set \\(I\\) is set to be a \textit{directed set} if for each pair \\(i, j\\) in \\(I\\) there exists \\(k\in I\\) such that \\(i\leq k\\) and \\(j\leq k\\).

Let \\(A\\) be a ring, let \\(I\\) be a direct set and let \\((M\_i)\_{i\in I}\\) be a family of \\(A\\)-modules indexed by \\(I\\). For each pair \\(i, j\\) in \\(I\\) such that \\(i\leq j\\), let \\(\mu\_{ij}:M\_i\to M\_j\\) be an \\(A\\)-homomorphism, and suppose that the following axioms are satisfied:


* \\(\mu\_{ii}\\) is the identity mapping of \\(M\_i\\) for all \\(i\in I\\).
* \\(\mu\_{ik}=\mu\_{jk}\circ\mu\_{ij}\\) whenever \\(i\leq j\leq k\\).


Then the modules \\(M\_i\\) and homomorphisms \\(\mu\_{ij}\\) are said to form a \textit{direct system} \\(\mathbf{M}=(M\_i,\mu\_{ij})\\) over the directed set \\(I\\).

We shall construct an \\(A\\)-module \\(M\\) called the \textit{direct limit} of the direct system \\(\mathbf{M}\\). Let \\(C\\) be the direct sum of the \\(M\_i\\), and identify each module \\(M\_i\\), with its canonical image in \\(C\\). Let \\(D\\) be the submodule of \\(C\\) generated by all elements of the form \\(x\_i-\mu\_{ij}(x\_i)\\) where \\(i\leq j\\) and \\(x\_i\in M\_i\\). Let \\(M = C/D\\), let \\(\mu:C\to M\\) be the projection and let \\(\mu\_i\\) be the restriction of \\(\mu\\) to \\(M\_i\\).

The module \\(M\\), or more correctly the pair consisting of \\(M\\) and the family of homomorphisms \\(\mu\_i:M\_i\to M\\) is called the \textit{direct limit} of the direct system \\(\mathbf{M}\\), and is written \\(\varinjlim M\_i\\). From the construction it is clear that \\(\mu\_i=\mu\_j\circ\mu\_{ij}\\) whenever \\(i\leq j\\).

## Problem 2

In the situation of Exercise 14, show that every element of \\(M\\) can be written in the form \\(\mu\_i(x\_i)\\) for some \\(i\in I\\) and some \\(x\_i\in M\_i\\).

Show also that if \\(\mu\_i(x\_i)=0\\) then there exists \\(j\geq i\\) such that \\(\mu\_{ij}(x\_i)=0\\) in \\(M\_j\\).

## Problem 3

Show that the direct limit is characterized (up to isomorphism) by the following property. Let \\(N\\) be an \\(A\\)-module and for each \\(i\in I\\) let \\(\alpha\_i :M\_i\to N\\) be an \\(A\\)-module homomorphism such that \\(\alpha\_i = \alpha\_j\circ\mu\_{ij}\\) whenever \\(i \leq j\\). Then there exists a unique homomorphism \\(\alpha: M\to N\\) such that \\(\alpha\_i=\alpha\circ\mu\_i\\) for all \\(i\in I\\).
