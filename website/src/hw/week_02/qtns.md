# Questions - Week 02

## Problem 1

`[DF 12.1.2]`

Let \\(M\\) be a module over the integral domain \\(R\\).

* (a) Suppose that \\(M\\) has rank \\(n\\) and that \\(x\_1, x\_2, \ldots, x\_n\\) is any maximal set of linearly independent elements of \\(M\\).

    Let \\(N=R x\_1+\ldots+R x\_n\\) be the submodule generated by \\(x\_1, x\_2, \ldots, x\_n\\).

    Prove that \\(N\\) is isomorphic to \\(R^n\\) and that the quotient \\(M / N\\) is a torsion \\(R\\)-module (equivalently, the elements \\(x\_1, \ldots, x\_n\\) are linearly independent and for any \\(y \in M\\) there is a nonzero element \\(r \in R\\) such that \\(r y\\) can be written as a linear combination \\(r\_1 x\_1+\ldots+r\_n x\_n\\) of the \\(\left.x\_i\right)\\).

* (b) Prove conversely that if \\(M\\) contains a submodule \\(N\\) that is free of rank \\(n\\) (i.e., \\(N \cong\\) \\(R^n\\) ) such that the quotient \\(M / N\\) is a torsion \\(R\\)-module then \\(M\\) has rank \\(n\\).

    [Let \\(y\_1, y\_2, \ldots, y\_{n+1}\\) be any \\(n+1\\) elements of \\(M\\).

    Use the fact that \\(M / N\\) is torsion to write \\(r\_i y\_i\\) as a linear combination of a basis for \\(N\\) for some nonzero elements \\(r\_1, \ldots, r\_{n+1}\\) of \\(R\\).

    Use an argument as in the proof of Proposition 3 to see that the \\(r\_i y\_i\\), and hence also the \\(y\_i\\), are linearly dependent.]



## Problem 2

`[DF 12.1.7]`

Let \\(R\\) be any ring, let \\(A\_1, A\_2, \ldots, A\_m\\) be \\(R\\)-modules and let \\(B\_i\\) be a submodule of \\(A\_i\\), \\(1 \leq i \leq m\\).

Prove that

\\[
\left(A\_1 \oplus A\_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus A\_m\right) /\left(B\_1 \oplus B\_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus B\_m\right) \cong\left(A\_1 / B\_1\right) \oplus\left(A\_2 / B\_2\right) \oplus \cdots \oplus\left(A\_m / B\_m\right) \text {.
}
\\]

## Problem 3

`[DF 12.1.11]`

Let \\(R\\) be a P.I.D., let \\(a\\) be a nonzero element of \\(R\\) and let \\(M=R /(a)\\).

For any prime \\(p\\) of \\(R\\) prove that

\\[
p^{k-1} M / p^k M \cong \begin{cases}R /(p) & \text { if } k \leq n \\\\ 0 & \text { if } k>n\end{cases}
\\]

where \\(n\\) is the power of \\(p\\) dividing \\(a\\) in \\(R\\).

## Problem 4

`[DF 12.1.16]`

The following set of exercises outlines a proof of Theorem 5 in the special case where \\(R\\) is a Euclidean Domain using a matrix argument involving row and column operations.

This applies in particular to the cases \\(R=\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(R=F[x]\\) of interest in the applications and is computationally useful.

Let \\(R\\) be a Euclidean Domain and let \\(M\\) be an \\(R\\)-module.

Prove that \\(M\\) is finitely generated if and only if there is a surjective \\(R\\)-homomorphism \\(\varphi: R^n \rightarrow M\\) for some integer \\(n\\) (this is true for any ring \\(R\\) ).

## Problem 5

`[DF 12.2.14]`

Determine all possible rational canonical forms for a linear transformation with characteristic polynomial \\(x^2\left(x^2+1\right)^2\\).
