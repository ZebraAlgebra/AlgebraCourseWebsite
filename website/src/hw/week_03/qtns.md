# Questions - Week 03

## Problem 1

Let \\(A\\) be a local ring, \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) finitely generated \\(A\\)-modules.

Prove that if \\(M \otimes N=0\\), then \\(M=0\\) or \\(N=0\\).

[Let \\(\mathfrak{m}\\) be the maximal ideal, \\(k=A / \mathfrak{m}\\) the residue field.

Let \\(M\_k=k \otimes\_A M \cong\\) \\(M / \mathfrak{m} M\\) by Exercise 2.

By Nakayama's lemma, \\(M\_k=0 \Rightarrow M=0\\).

But \\(M \otimes\_A N=0 \Rightarrow\left(M \otimes\_A N\right)\_k=0 \Rightarrow M\_k \otimes\_k N\_k=0 \Rightarrow M\_k=0\\) or \\(N\_k=0\\),
since \\(M\_k, N\_k\\) are vector spaces over a field.]

## Problem 2

Let \\(M\\) be a finitely generated \\(A\\)-module and \\(\phi: M \rightarrow A\^n\\) a surjective homomorphism. Show that \\(\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)\\) is finitely generated.

[Let \\(e\_1, \ldots, e\_n\\) be a basis of \\(A\^n\\) and choose \\(u\_i \in M\\) such that \\(\phi\left(u\_i\right)=e\_i\\) \\((1 \leqslant i \leqslant n)\\). Show that \\(M\\) is the direct sum of \\(\operatorname{Ker}(\phi)\\) and the submodule generated by \\(\left.u\_1, \ldots, u\_n \cdot\right]\\)

## Problem 3

Let \\(\mathfrak{a}\\) be an ideal of a ring \\(A\\), and let \\(S=1+\mathfrak{a}\\).

Show that \\(S\^{-1} \mathfrak{a}\\) is contained in the Jacobson radical of \\(S\^{-1} A\\).

Use this result and Nakayama's lemma to give a proof of (2.5) which does not depend on determinants.

[If \\(M=\mathfrak{a} M\\), then \\(S\^{-1} M=\left(S\^{-1} \mathfrak{a}\right)\left(S\^{-1} M\right)\\), hence by Nakayama we have \\(S\^{-1} M=0\\). Now use Exercise 1.]

## Problem 4

The set \\(S\_0\\) of all non-zero-divisors in \\(A\\) is a saturated multiplicatively closed subset of \\(A\\).

Hence the set \\(D\\) of zero-divisors in \\(A\\) is a union of prime ideals (see Chapter 1, Exercise 14).

Show that every minimal prime ideal of \\(A\\) is contained in D. [Use Exercise 6.]

The ring \\(S\_0\^{-1} A\\) is called the \textit{total ring of fractions} of \\(A\\).

Prove that


* i) \\(S\_0\\) is the largest multiplicatively closed subset of \\(A\\) for which the homomorphism \\(A \rightarrow S\_0\^{-1} A\\) is injective.

* ii) Every element in \\(S\_0\^{-1} A\\) is either a zero-divisor or a unit.

* iii) Every ring in which every non-unit is a zero-divisor is equal to its total ring of fractions (i.e., \\(A \rightarrow S\_0\^{-1} A\\) is bijective).


## Problem 5

`[Lang XVI.4]`

[Nakayama's lemma]

Let \\(R\\) be any ring and \\(M\\) a finitely generated module.

Let \\(N\\) be the radical of \\(R\\).

If \\(N M=M\\) show that \\(M=0\\).

[Hint: Observe that the proof of Nakayama's lemma still holds.]

## Problem 6

`[Lang XVI.5]`

* (a) Let \\(J\\) be a two-sided nilpotent ideal of \\(R\\).

    Show that \\(J\\) is contained in the radical.

* (b) Conversely, assume that \\(R\\) is Artinian.

    Show that its radical is nilpotent, i.e., that there exists an integer \\(r \geqq 1\\) such that \\(N\^r=0\\).

    [Hint: Consider the descending sequence of powers \\(N\^r\\), and apply Nakayama to a minimal finitely generated left ideal \\(L \subset N\^{\infty}\\) such that \\(N\^{\infty} L \neq 0\\).]
